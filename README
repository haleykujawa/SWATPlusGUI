OWC-SWAT+ GUI

Folder structure should look like

Main Folder
Scripts.R
	
	Baseline (is TxtInOut)
	data (potential delete)
	Scenarios
		CNRM (is TxtInOut)
		hist (is TxtInOut)
		IPSL-CM5A-MR (is TxtInOut)
		MIROC5 (is TxtInOut)
	www
	UW Climate Data
		CNRM
			hist
			future
		ACCESS
			hist
			...

ReadClimDataWriteSWAT reads output files I processed on the external harddrive in the format date / tmp / pcp
in the UW Climate Data folder. It is not part of the GUI end product other than processing data needed for the GUI.
