OWC-SWAT+ GUI

Folder structure should look like

Main Folder
Scripts.R
	
	Baseline (original TxtInOut)
	data (potential delete)
	Scenarios
		hyd-sed-lte.cha (edited mgt file, copied into userClimScen and hist)
		hydrology.hyd (edited mgt file, copied into userClimScen and hist)
		hru-data.hru (edited mgt file, copied into userClimScen and hist)
		userClimScen/  --> user climate data + mgt changes
		userClimScen_baseline/ --> historical (1986-2019)
		hist/ --> mgt changes (climate = 2013-2020)
	www
	UW Climate Data
		CNRM
			hist
			future
		ACCESS
			hist
			...

ReadClimDataWriteSWAT reads output files I processed on the external harddrive in the format date / tmp / pcp
in the UW Climate Data folder. It is not part of the GUI end product other than processing data needed for the GUI.
